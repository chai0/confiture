      <p>
        This recipe is really a cross between plum jam and plum preserves. It
        still has some of it’s preserve- like plum chunks, <br />
        but it’s nice and thick and spreads beautifully. It’s awesome paired
        with breakfast pancakes or crepes. <br />
        Oh and this would make the sweetest Christmas gift!

      <h3>Grape jam</h3>
      <img src="./images/Grape jam.jpeg" />
      <p>
        In fruits with a large amount of liquid, it is advisable to use the
        technique of drying in the sun. <br />
        This way, especially in the arid regions of the country, it is
        possible to obtain a thick jam that is extremely light in color.
      </p>
      <h5>Ingredients:</h5>

      <ul>
        <li>1kg of grapes without pits.</li>
        <li>900 grams of sugar.</li>
        <li>Juice from 2 lemons.</li>
        <li>
          Option: 100 g of muscat grapes (as part of the total weight of the
          fruit).
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h5>Preparation:</h5>
      <ol>
        <li>
          Put the sugar in a baking pan and place in a baking oven, preheated
          to 150 degrees.
        </li>
        <li>
          Put the grapes in a heavy saucepan and add the hot sugar. Cook over
          low heat until boiling. Fold the foam all the while cooking.
        </li>
        <li>
          When the jam starts to get a golden amber color, add the lemon juice
          and cook for another 5 minutes. <br />
          Turn off the flame and transfer to flat pans. The height of the jam
          should be 2-3 cm. Use two molds if necessary.
        </li>
        <li>
          Transfer the molds to the sun. Cover the surface of the pan with a
          baking sheet from the oven, and place a gauze cloth on it. <br />
          As darkness falls, the mold should be covered with plastic wrap. The
          jam should be dried for several days, until it thickens. Occasional
          gentle stirring will help to dry faster.
        </li>
      </ol>
