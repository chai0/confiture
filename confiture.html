<h3>Grape jam</h3>
<p>In fruits with a large amount of liquid, it is advisable to use the technique of drying in the sun.
<br> This way, especially in the arid regions of the country, it is possible to obtain a thick jam that is
extremely light in color.</p>
<h5>Ingredients:</h5>

<ul>
<li>1kg of grapes without pits.</li>
<li>900 grams of sugar.</li>
<li>Juice from 2 lemons.</li>
<li>Option: 100 g of muscat grapes (as part of the total weight of the fruit).</li>
</ul>
<h5>Preparation:</h5>
<ol>
<li>Put the sugar in a baking pan and place in a baking oven, preheated to 150 degrees.</li>
<li>Put the grapes in a heavy saucepan and add the hot sugar. Cook over low heat until boiling.
Fold the foam all the while cooking.</li>
<li>When the jam starts to get a golden amber color, add the lemon juice and cook for another 5
minutes.
<br> Turn off the flame and transfer to flat pans. The height of the jam should be 2-3 cm. Use two
molds if necessary.</li>
<li>Transfer the molds to the sun. Cover the surface of the pan with a baking sheet from the oven,
and place a gauze cloth on it.
<br> As darkness falls, the mold should be covered with plastic wrap. The jam should be dried for
several days, until it thickens.
Occasional gentle stirring will help to dry faster.</li>
